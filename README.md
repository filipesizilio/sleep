# Sleep
Simple scheduling program to basically turn off your PC and other schedules.


This is the first program I created in 2003, using Borland Delphi (that was a good time!) but unfortunately I no longer have the source codes.

With it you can schedule a time to turn off or restart the computer, you can also schedule a message/reminder for yourself or run a program.

For Windows only. Despite its age, I tested it on Windows 10 and it works, despite the annoying protection warning.
